      <p>
        <font face="verdana">This is the first paragraph of the test. From a distance, these words may look important and significant to the website itself, but it's a mere distraction.
        In this paragraph, tools such as <i>italics</i>, <u>underline</u>, and <b>bold</b> will be tested. Also, different <font face="impact">fonts</font> and <font color="orange">font colors</font> will be tested, and even the <font size="5">size</font> of
        some words will change. Keep in mind, all of these changes are made through HTML, rather than CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, this is the second paragraph. This paragraph is to transition to the next section. In the next paragraph,
        edits of the code will be made through CSS, not HTML, so remember that
        the paragraph looks normal when viewing it in HTML.
      </p>
      <p id="para3">
        The color is blue.
      </p>
      <p id="para4">
        Now, the color is green.
      </p>
      <p id="para5">
        The color is black (default) now, but the size has decreased.
      </p>
      <p id="para6">
        The font size has now increased, AND the font color is red.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's move on to more things that you can do with HTML. You can make lists, tables, images, and you can even put a background for the
        website, as you can see behind this text. Let's start with a bulleted list and a numbered list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <h4>List of Programming Languages that have a decent amount of difficulty</h2>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>(a lot more)</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <h4>List of a few Programming Languages in order of most to least amount of difficulty (this list lies on the foundation of pure opinion)</h2>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This is the official logo of HTML: (keep in mind, this image was resized in HTML. It's a little larger without any resizing)
      </p>
      <img src="https://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Logo_256.png" height="175" width="125">
      <p>
        Now, this is a simple table displaying the release dates of iOS updates:
      </p>
      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
          <th>Update Version</th>
          <th>Date Released</th>
          <th>Current Status</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3.1.3</td>
          <td>2/2/2010</td>
          <td>Discontinued</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7.1.2</td>
          <td>6/30/2014</td>
          <td>Discontinued</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>12.4.5</td>
          <td>1/28/2020</td>
          <td>Discontinued</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>13.3.1</td>
          <td>1/28/2020</td>
          <td>Current</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>13.4 Beta 5</td>
          <td>3/10/2020</td>
          <td>Beta</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        This is the end of the website page.
      </p>
    </body>
